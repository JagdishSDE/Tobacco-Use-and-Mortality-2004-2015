Overview 📁
This project provides a data analysis and visualization pipeline for an admissions dataset. The goal is to clean and preprocess the data, analyze key metrics, and visualize trends related to admissions by year, disease type, and other attributes. The dataset includes information on admissions, attributable numbers, and demographic breakdowns.
